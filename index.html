                <h2>The founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> was the visionary leader who founded Pakistan and gave
                    direction to
                    the destiny of millions. He devoted his life to the struggle for the political rights and freedom of
                    Muslims in the subcontinent. His leadership was rooted in justice, equality, and the supremacy of
                    law. Through patience, wisdom, and unwavering determination, he turned a challenging dream into
                    reality. He firmly believed that unity, faith, and discipline were essential for building a strong
                    nation. Quaid-e-Azam led with honesty, moral courage, and a deep sense of responsibility. Even in
                    the most difficult times, he never compromised on principles. His words and actions continue to
                    guide Pakistan on its path forward. Quaid-e-Azam's legacy remains alive in the heart of the nation.
